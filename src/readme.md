### Todo:

* [X] Initial Data exploration and cleaning
* [X] initial PCA
* [x] PCA on reduced feature set
* [ ] Understand the features

  * [X] Filter away more features, not relevant - noise, fw_year, etc.s
  * [x] Add computed feature? - 
* [ ] Find timeseries data of Polarization by country
* [ ] Select Correlated features?
* [X] automate the pre processing of dataset

  * [ ] filter features
  * [X] save csv in processed folder by, country and year
* [ ] Consider different countries for diversity, in europe, Since Norway, Denmark and Germany is quite similar

  * [ ] Could be Italy, France, Poland this might also have quite strong polarization

* [ ] ResIN

  * [ ] Create Graph
  * [ ] Find initial set of Polarising questions 
  * [ ] Connect questions in the graph
  * [ ] compute binary variable for the rows with most strongly held beliefs (1-10) select 1,2 and 9-10 as agree or oppose
  * [ ] Visualise the graph 
  * [ ] Ensure that the distance is proportional to weight
  * [ ] Color based on left leaning oppinions?
  * [ ] Align axis through PCA
  * [ ] Create Linearization score
  * [ ] Try for different countries
